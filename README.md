# Kolmogorov Complexity
Kolmogorov complexity of an object or algorithm is the length of its optimal specification. 
In algorithmic information theory, the Kolmogorov complexity of an object, is the length of a shortest computer program that produces the object as output. 
It is a measure of the computational resources needed to specify the object, and is also known as algorithmic complexity or algorithmic entropy.
